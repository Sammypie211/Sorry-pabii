      <h2>A Poem for You</h2>
      <p>
        I wrote your name upon the sky,<br>
        But winds of anger made it fly.<br>
        I called your soul with words so true,<br>
        But silence only answered too.<br>
        Forgive these flaws I can’t erase,<br>
        Let love once more our lives embrace.<br>
        For in your heart my home remains,<br>
        Beyond these tears and past these pains.<br>
        (Kinda bad at this but I tried ahem.)

      <h2>A Promise to Be Better</h2>
      <p>
        I promise to be better, to listen more, and to cherish you every day. I will work hard to regain your trust and
        show you how much you mean to me. You are my spark, and I will do whatever it takes to make things right. I know I seriously 
        annoyed you alot, I know my behaviour wasnt good, I admit I was a really bad boyfriend, But I've fixed most of my insecurities, and Iam making myself a better person for you,
        I will obey whatever you say, and be however you want me to be (I mean, I realised not meeting daily is okay, and etc other things)
        I promise, I'll never repeat those mistakes again 🫠
        with this chance, I will really really be much better than before, I'll support you even at your lowest,
        I wanna be the reason you smile, laugh, be happy, and feel comforted! 
        I will accept any conditions you put (like not meeting today or tmrw or smthg)
        I promise I'll control my emotions, insecurities, and I'll try to never let it be the reason we fight or argue,
        I promise I'll hold your hand even when its hard, you already are my 1st priority, but I promise you'll always be my 1st priority,
        this time, I'll really listen to you, make sure you arent facing any problems, and I'll really take care of you,
        I cant be the best person in the world, but I certainly can keep improving,
        Iam really willing to keep trying, and as you say that "it is really difficult to handle me", no matter how difficult it gets
        but Iam never giving up on you, I love you, even though you have flaws, I accept each of your flaws, mood swings, irritations, and etc (I actuallly love it tbh)..
        With this chance, I dont want to make things back the way they were, instead I wanna start a new bond,
        And I really promise to be there for you no matter what, this time I'll understand your POV,
        Become a mature person, both from will and mentality, I'll maintain my personality, and I will really really listen to you,
        I'll again be the person you loved back then, but this time, I'll really be better, more than ever.
        Lastly, I promise Iam never gonna make you suffocated like before, You are my favorite person,
        And you'll always remain my favorite person 🌹..!
